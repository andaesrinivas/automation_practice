Feature: As a QA, I would like to verify all negative scenarios for login

  Background:
    Given I am on scores-fixtures page

  Scenario Outline: Submit Login form with correct username and incorrect password
    And I navigate to login page
    When I attempt to login with correct "<username>" and incorrect "<password>"
    Then my login attempt should fail with wrong password "<error>"
    Examples:
      | username           | password  | error                           |
      | test1237@gmail.com | summer777 | Sorry |
